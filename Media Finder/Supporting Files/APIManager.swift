 "description":"“When you think that life cannot get better, Blake Pierce comes up with another masterpiece of thriller and mystery! This book is full of twists and the end brings a surprising revelation. I strongly recommend this book to the permanent library of any reader that enjoys a very well written thriller.”<br />--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re Almost Gone) <br /><br />LEFT TO DIE is book #1 in a new FBI thriller series by USA Today bestselling author Blake Pierce, whose #1 bestseller Once Gone (Book #1) (a free download) has received over 1,000 five star reviews. <br /><br />FBI special agent Adele Sharp is a German-and-French raised American with triple citizenship—and an invaluable asset in bringing criminals to justice as they cross American and European borders.<br /><br />When a serial killer case spanning three U.S. states goes cold, Adele returns to San Francisco and to the man she hopes to marry. But after a shocking twist, a new lead surfaces and Adele is dispatched to Paris, to lead an international manhunt.<br /><br />Adele returns to the Europe of her childhood, where familiar Parisian streets, old friends from the DGSI and her estranged father reignite her dormant obsession with solving her own mother’s murder. All the while she must hunt down the diabolical killer, must enter the dark canals of his psychotic mind to know where he will strike next—and save the next victim before it’s too late.<br /><br />An action-packed mystery series of international intrigue and riveting suspense, LEFT TO DIE will have you turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />Books #2 and #3 in the series – LEFT TO RUN and LEFT TO HIDE – are also available for preorder!"},

However, along her journey, she’ll learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world—it’s going to take trust and teamwork as well. \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" features the voices of Kelly Marie Tran as Raya, a warrior whose wit is as sharp as her blade, and Awkwafina as the magical, mythical, self-deprecating dragon named Sisu.

 "longDescription":"The sensation of the Cannes Film Festival and the most controversial film of the year, Blue is the Warmest Color made cinema history as the first film ever awarded the Palme d'Or to both its director and its actresses. In a star-making role, Adèle Exarchopoulos is Adèle, a passionate young woman who has a yearning she doesn't quite understand until a chance encounter with the blue-haired Emma ignites a flame and brings her to life. Léa Seydoux (Midnight in Paris) gives a fearless performance as Emma, the older woman who excites Adèle's desire and becomes the love of her life. Abdellatif Kechiche's (The Secret of the Grain) intimate epic of tenderness and passion charts their relationship over the course of several years, from the ecstasy of a first kiss to the agony of heartbreak. Pulsing with gestures, embraces, furtive exchanges, and arias of joy and devastation, Blue is the Warmest Color is a profoundly moving hymn to both love and life."},

 "description":"“When you think that life cannot get better, Blake Pierce comes up with another masterpiece of thriller and mystery! This book is full of twists and the end brings a surprising revelation. I strongly recommend this book to the permanent library of any reader that enjoys a very well written thriller.”<br /><br />--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re Almost Gone)<br /><br />LEFT TO HUNT is book #9 in a new FBI thriller series featuring Adele Sharp (the series begins with LEFT TO DIE, book #1) by USA Today bestselling author Blake Pierce, whose #1 bestseller Once Gone (a free download) has received over 1,000 five star reviews. <br /><br />When masked victims turn up dead at midnight balls in Venice, FBI Special Agent Adele Sharp—triple agent of the U.S., France and Germany—is summoned to find the killer before he can strike again.<br /><br />As Adele navigates the historic canals of Venice in her hunt for a killer, she wonders if there is an unseen pattern to the murders. Is it a nod to history? Or merely the work of a deranged mind?<br /><br />An action-packed mystery series of international intrigue and riveting suspense, LEFT TO HUNT will leave you turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />Book #10 in the series—LEFT TO FEAR—is now also available!"},

 "description":"„Wenn man glaubt, das Leben könnte nicht besser werden, schafft Blake Pierce ein weiteres Thriller Meisterwerk voller Mysterien! Dieses Buch ist voller Wendungen und das Ende bringt eine überraschende Enthüllung, die man nie erwartet hätte. Ich empfehle jedem Leser, der Freude an einem sehr gut geschriebenen Thriller hat, dringend sich dieses Buch zuzulegen. ” — Bücher und Filmkritiken, Roberto Mattos<br /><br />NICHTS ALS STERBEN ist Buch Nr. 1 in einer neuen FBI-Thriller-Serie von USA Today Bestsellerautor Blake Pierce, dessen Bestseller Nr. 1 VERSCHWUNDEN (Buch Nr. 1) (ein kostenloser Download) über 1.000 Fünf-Sterne-Kritiken erhalten hat. <br /><br />Die FBI-Spezialagentin Adele Sharp ist eine deutsch-französische, aber in den USA aufgewachsene, Amerikanerin mit dreifacher Staatsbürgerschaft — und ein unschätzbarer Gewinn, wenn es darum geht, Kriminelle beim Überqueren der amerikanischen und europäischen Grenzen vor Gericht zu bringen.<br /><br />Als ein Serienmörder-Fall, der sich über drei US-Bundesstaaten erstreckt, kalt wird, kehrt Adele nach San Francisco zu dem Mann zurück, den sie zu heiraten hofft. Doch nach einer schockierenden Wendung taucht eine neue Spur auf und Adele wird nach Paris geschickt, um die Leitung einer internationalen Verbrecherjagd zu übernehmen.<br /><br />Adele kehrt in das Europa ihrer Kindheit zurück, wo die vertrauten Pariser Straßen, alte Freunde aus der DGSI und ihr entfremdeter Vater ihre schlummernde Besessenheit von der Aufklärung des Mordes an ihrer eigenen Mutter wieder entfachen. Sie muss sie den teuflischen Mörder jagen, muss in die dunklen Ecken seines psychotischen Geistes eindringen, um zu erfahren, wo er als Nächstes zuschlagen wird — und das nächste Opfer retten, bevor es zu spät ist.<br /><br />Eine actiongeladene Mysteryreihe voller internationaler Intrigen und fesselnder Spannung. Mit NICHTS ALS STERBEN werden Sie bis spät in die Nacht blättern.<br /><br />Die Bücher Nr. 2 und Nr. 3 der Reihe — NICHTS ALS RENNEN und NICHTS ALS VERSTECKEN — können bereits jetzt vorbestellt werden!"},
